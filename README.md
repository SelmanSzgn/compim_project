These codes are based on the implementation of the T3SC model that we can find [here](https://github.com/inria-thoth/T3SC). They provide some examples of how to use pre-trained model to perform some tests and visualize the results.

This repository contains the following files:
- `compim_pretrained_icvl.ipynb` : A notebook which visualizes the test step of pre-trained models on the ICVL dataset.
